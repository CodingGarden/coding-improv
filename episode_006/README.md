## Idea

* [x] Get an image from the LeagueOfLegends API
* [x] Classify the image with AI (gets a list of labels)
* [x] Display a zoomed in section of the image to the user
* [x] User has options to guess from (one option is AI suggestion)
* [x] If chosen correctly - NICE PIANO SOUND
* [x] If chosen incorrectly - BAD PIANO SOUND
* [x] load a new one...
* [x] If you get 5 right -  stamp of approval
* [x] If you get 5 wrong - oats fall from the sky
